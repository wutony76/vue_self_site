              Joining the contract can generate income immediately. Cloud mining
              is an investment product with long-term stable income. Income is
              determined by one's own principal. No matter how much principal
              you invest, you will gain something in the second month. Your
              profit period will last forever, and the amount of profit depends
              on your principal and the time of joining the contract. Financial
              management with a high rate of return is accompanied by high
              risks. What we can guarantee is the stability of income, and all
              members will not lose their principal. Really achieve zero-risk
              investment.<br />The basic wallet investment return rate is as
              follows, and the investment amount will be calculated
              cumulatively.<br />When the cumulative total investment amount
              reaches 4TRX -10000TRX or more, the basic daily cash withdrawal
              amount is 2.5%<br />When the total accumulated investment reaches
              more than 30000TRX -50000TRX, the daily basic withdrawal is 3%<br />When
              the total accumulated investment reaches more than 200,000TRX, the
              daily basic withdrawal is 4%<br />When the cumulative total
              investment reaches 500,000TRX or more, the daily basic withdrawal
              limit is 5%<br />
              <p>
                When the cumulative total investment reaches 1000,000TRX or
                more, the daily basic withdrawal limit is 8%
